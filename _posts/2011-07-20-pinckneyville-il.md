I attended my buddy’s wedding in Pinckneyville, IL earlier this summer. This was the first time to bring my Holga out of the state. It came back missing the lens cap and with the film padding torn out. I’m not even sure how that one happened. Overall, it was a pretty fun trip. Here are some frames from the weekend.
