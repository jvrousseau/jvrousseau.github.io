description: Visualizing Turfjs greatness in mapbox.js

In a recent browsing through twitter, I discovered Turfjs. Turfjs is an open-source gis engine written in JavaScript. Morgan Herlocker ([@morganherlocker](https://twitter.com/morganherlocker){:target="_blank"}) is the creator of the project and is a great Twitter resource. Go follow him!

Since using Turfjs in a recent project, I have become addicted. I'm trying to introduce it to as many people as I can (especially at work). While anyone with gis knowledge can pick up how to use each module, I thought it might be a steep learning curve for non-gis folk.

In a non-applicable way, I started to think that mapbox.js could be a great resource to show off the functionality of Turfjs.

Enter my latest project. I shamelessly used the layout of the mapbox.js examples (at least I'm not the first one to do[it](https://twitter.com/tmcw/statuses/479001183558696960){:target="_blank"}) to show off each TurfJS module. I'm hoping the folks at Mapbox will take the imitation as a sincere form of flattery!

I'm not quite done with the examples. I will be working those out as soon as I can, but I'm stoked about getting the examples out there so folks can visualize the power of Turfjs.

You can check out the examples at[http://rousseau.io/turf-mapboxjs](http://rousseau.io/turf-mapboxjs)
